I AM IN THE PROCESS OF "REFACTORING" THIS LIBRARY. The Core and DateTime have been refactored so that the library can either be included in toto or selectively. The LibTomMaths and UTF8 libs have yet to be refactored.

This is a library of Red/System function collections. The collections that have been started are:
       
       Core          - Core functions to support other libs 
       DateTime      - Date and time functions
       LibTomMaths   - The start of a partial implementation of LibTom
       UTF8          - Functions for handling UTF-8 strings

They are all at a very early stage of development. 

By the convention, the functions return an integer return code whilst their results are returned
in a user supplied argument (or arguments). The exception to this are functions where the return
value is either true or false. Typically the name of these functions end in a ?.

Each of the function and compiler definition names begins with the prefix PWAW- followed by a short mnenomic to
indicate which library (e.g. PWAW-LTM for LibTomMaths).

The script for compilation and testing is written in Ruby and require the correct path to the Red compiler to
be recorded in the file path-to-red.txt. (This will be replacesd by a Red script once Red has relevant capabilities.)
