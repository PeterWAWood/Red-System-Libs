This is a library of Red/System function collections. The collections that have been started are:
       
       Core          - Core functions to support other libs 
       Date-Time     - Date and time functions
       Int64         - 64-bit integer arithmetic
       LibTomMaths   - A partial implementation of LibTom
       UTF-8         - Functions for handling UTF-8 strings

They are all at a very early stage of development.

Scripts for compilation and testing are written in Rebol and Ruby.

By the convention, the functions return an integer return code whilst their results are returned
in a user supplied argument (or arguments). The exception to this are functions where the return
value is either true or false. Typically the name of these functions end in a ?.
