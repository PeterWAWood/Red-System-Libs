This is a library of Red/System function collections. Two collections have been started:
       
        IO-Utils              - Basic input and output functions
        UTF-8-Utils           - Functons for handling UTF-8 strings

They are both at a very early stage of development.

Supporting link libraries are written using the Free Pascal Compiler. Binary versions of link libraries 
for Linux, OS X and Windows are provided.

Scripts for compilation and testing are written in Ruby.
