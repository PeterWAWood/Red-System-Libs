This is a library of Red/System function collections. The collections that have been started are:
       
       Core          - Core functions to support other libs 
       Date-Time     - Date and time functions
       Int64         - 64-bit integer arithmetic
       LibTomMaths   - A partial implementation of LibTom
       UTF-8         - Functions for handling UTF-8 strings

They are all at a very early stage of development.

Scripts for compilation and testing are written in Rebol and Ruby.
