This is a library of Red/System function collections. Three collections have been started:
       
       Core                  - Basic functions to support other libs 
       Date-Time             - Basic date and time functions
       Int64                 - Functions for 64-bit integer subtraction and division using external libraries
                                   pre-compiled libraries are provided for Windows 32, Libc 32 and OS X
                                   needed by date-difference function under Windows
       UTF-8                 - Functions for handling UTF-8 strings

They are all at a very early stage of development.

Scripts for compilation and testing are written in Rebol.
